              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                Hello, my name is I Gede Kasuma Dana, though most people call me
                Kasuma. I am a student specializing in Software Engineering at a
                vocational school in Denpasar. Born and raised in this vibrant
                city, I have always had a deep passion for technology. I also
                enjoy photography as a hobby, capturing interesting moments in
                life even if it remains just a pastime.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most memorable experiences in my life took place when
                I was in the 2nd grade. I had the rare opportunity to perform at
                the Bali Arts Festival. Stepping onto the stage at the Art
                Center in Ardha Candra, together with my art group, Sanggar
                Drupadi, and Palawara—a music ensemble collaborating with our
                group—opened my eyes to the beauty of the arts and sparked a
                creativity that I continue to nurture.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, not every chapter of my life has been filled with joy.
                Several years ago, I experienced profound sorrow when my
                great-grandparents passed away. This loss hit me hard,
                especially since my great-grandfather was a cherished figure who
                always accompanied me as I played musical instruments in our
                village. That experience taught me the importance of cherishing
                every moment with our loved ones.

            <p>
              Throughout my educational journey, I have actively participated in
              the Spensix Multimedia Computer Club, where I focused on honing my
              skills in Microsoft Word. During this time, I achieved several
              accomplishments, such as winning competitions at Alfa Prima and at
              a local high school event. I also proudly earned accolades in a
              quiz competition organized by FAD Denpasar and in an essay contest
              held by Bank BPD Bali. In the 8th grade, I was entrusted with the
              role of Microsoft Word coordinator and later served as Vice
              Chairman of the club. Perhaps, if I had not joined this
              organization, I might never have developed my interest in Software
              Engineering or pursued my current educational path.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking ahead, I aspire to continue developing my potential. After
              completing my vocational education, I plan to pursue higher
              studies in Informatics Engineering at Politeknik Negeri Bali.
              While in college, I also intend to take on a part-time job to gain
              further experience and broaden my horizons in the ever-evolving
              world of technology.
